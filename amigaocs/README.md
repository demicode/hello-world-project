Amiga OCS
========
Uses copper to setup display. This version is kind of system friendly, allowing 
you to return to the Workbench by pressing the left mouse button.

Tools
-----
This code was written intended to be assembled by the exellent *vasm*,
using the exact same version that I used for the Atari ST version. 
See the Makefile for the flags used for generating the Amiga excutable.

I used WinUAE for executing the code.
