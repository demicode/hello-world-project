The Hello World project
=======================

A collection of assembly code to display a 'Hello World' message on screen 
for various oldschool platforms.

The intention is to learn to write code for new (to me) and old platforms
and to maybe inspire other to start coding assembler for these platforms,
when they see how easy (?) it can be to get started.

The goal is to make use of the hardware instead of any OS functions. I 
will not put any effort in being system friendly or so, just do the initial
setup that is needed to draw the graphics on the screen.

This is about programming graphics, not to use a console to output text.

Tools
-----
For compilation I will try to use tools that are freely avaliable for
anyone to download, and I will atleast write down the tools I used and
add a download link when possible.

Current platforms
-----------------
Currently code is implemented for the following platforms.

 * Atari ST
 * Amiga OCS
 * Game Boy Advance
 * Sega Master System
 * Game Boy

In progress
----------------
Implementations on some platforms has begun, but is not 100% complete.
In some cases it's 99% done, in others 1%.

Currently, I have not decided what platform to do next.

Planned
----------------
I intend to include code for the following hardware. If you want to
see more platforms, just send me a request and I will maybe add it 
to the list.

 * Sega Mega Drive
 * SNES
 * NES
 * Atari 8bit
 * MSX
 * C64

Disclaimer
----------
This project is made for my own pleasure, and I take no responsibility 
if the code harm you computer(s) in any way. I do not claim that the my
solutions are the best way, or even a good way to do what they intend to.
I do this to learn new platforms, not to collect code from
other people that implements what I want to do.
