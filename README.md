The Hello World project
=======================

The idea I had was to create a collection of Hello World-like hacks for
many different oldschool platforms, in assembly. The goal is to make use
of the hardware instead of any OS functions.

I will not put any effort in being system friendly or so, just do the 
initial setup that is needed to draw the text on the screen.

Tools
-----
For compilation I will try to use tools that are freely avaliable for
anyone to download, and I will atleast write down the tools I used and
add a download link when possible.


Planned platforms
-----------------

 * Atari ST
 * Sega Master System


Future platforms
----------------
 * Amiga OCS
