Atari ST
========
This code have been the easiest to write, doing it all 
from memory. 

Tools
-----
This code was written intended to be assembled by the exellent *vasm*. 
It can probably be assembled using devpac on native hardware too, but
I have not verified that.
You the vasmm68k with motorola syntax to be able to assemble correctly.

I recommend using Hatari to run the program if you want to emulate.
